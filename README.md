# Blockchain
This implementation of blockchain is a project of mine undertaken for my bachelor's project in computer science in my 6th semester of college. The project's title is :

# Effects of Quantum Computing on Blockchain
A blockchain is a digital tool that uses cryptography techniques to protect information from unauthorized changes. Blockchain-related products are used everywhere from finance and manufacturing to health care, in a market worth more than US$150 billion.

At the same time, we are also witnessing the rise of quantum computing. It is clear from the academic research and presented stipulation that soon quantum computing will surpass the high computational requirements that are needed to keep the blockchain secure and of other cryptographic algorithms. The ideology behind this claim is that a blockchain maintains its secrecy by running a cryptographic algorithm which is a one-way function. Although there are algorithms to break one-way functions but the classical computers are simply incapable of doing the calculation required by these algorithms. But with access to computational power as vast as quantum computers theoretically offer, the one-way cryptographic functions would no longer be valid, therefore, breaking the security of a blockchain. That is why, it is speculated that within a decade, quantum computers will be able to break a blockchainâ€™s cryptographic technology.

In this project, I intend to implement a blockchain model and will assess the presented claims about quantum computing as a threat to blockchain.

So to understand the workings of a blockchain to the tiniest working fundamentals, I'm implementing this blockchain by which I should be able to understand the nitty-gritty of it and then manipulate it accordingly, to find the probable vulnerabilities.
